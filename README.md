## Objectives

Build a very simple ReactJS app written to view tagged flicker pictures.

ðŸ’¥ BOOM ðŸ’¥

[Click here to see the Demo](https://psenger.github.io/reactjs-flickr/build/index.html)

## Usage

This mvp was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), Node version 6.9.0, and React 15.5.4. To facility the example, the base commands have been distilled to the following NPM scripts:

### to build the final product

Once completed, the code is in the ``/build`` directory. make sure to do the ``build:css`` before ``build``.

```sh
export PUBLIC_URL=https://psenger.github.io/reactjs-flickr/build/
export NODE_ENV=production
npm install
npm run build:css
npm run build
```

### Rapid development

You can run a local server, in watch mode. This allows the user to develop quickly.

```sh
export NODE_ENV=development
npm install
npm start
open http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

### How to build the css

All the scss is written in SASS and the Bootstrap libray is here if you want to turn things on or off.

```sh
npm run build:css
```

### How to run the tests

_If I had time to write any, it would have been ..._


```bash
npm install
npm test
```

## High lights

1. uses my favorite rapid prototype frame work [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
2. Use of Sagas
3. Use of Accessibility with Twitter Bootstrap React components.

## Directory Structure
